<p> National overview </p>
<p> Over {Num tested} people have been tested for COVID-19 in Canada. This corresponds to a test rate of {Rate tested} per 1 million people. Of all people tested, {Tested positive}% have been found to be positive.

<p> * The new cases, deaths and tests reflect the net change between the current day and the previous reported day. Some provinces and territories do not provide daily updates. </p>
<p> N/A indicates no daily update provided by province/territory. </p>
<p> Tables and figures included below reflect only detailed case information data provided to the Public Health Agency of Canada by provincial/territorial health authorities. </p>
<p> Epidemic curve </p>
<p> Detailed case report data were provided on cases; episode date was available for (%) cases, and both exposure and episode date were available for (%) cases. </p>
<p> The shaded area in Figure 2 represents a period of time (lag time) where it is expected that cases have occurred but have not yet been reported nationally. There is an approximate 1 to 2 week delay when a person becomes ill and when their information is reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada, as a result of the time required to seek healthcare, get tested and receive results. It also takes time for public health authorities to gather information on cases. Therefore, new information will be provided as it becomes available. </p>
