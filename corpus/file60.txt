<p> NEW YORK — The Wuhan coronavirus spreading from China is now likely to become a pandemic that circles the globe, according to many of the world’s leading infectious disease specialists. </p>
<p> The prospect is daunting. A pandemic — an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents — may well have global consequences, despite the extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines imposed by China and other countries, including the United States. </p>
<p> Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans. </p>
<p> The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found. </p>
<p> “It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. </p>
<p> “But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know.” </p>
<p> In the last three weeks, the number of lab-confirmed cases has soared from about 50 in China to 14,000 in 23 countries; there have been over 300 deaths, all but one in China. The first death outside China was recorded Sunday in the Philippines. </p>
<p> The Philippine Health Department said a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan died from the virus and his companion remained hospitalized. Vietnam counted its seventh case, a Vietnamese American man who had a two-hour layover in Wuhan on his way from the United States to Ho Chi Minh City. </p>
<p> The US total rose to 11 cases, mostly involving recent travel to Wuhan. </p>
<p> As the United States steps up its response to the outbreak, the Department of Homeland Security is warning airline passengers that their flights may wind up rerouted if officials discover mid-flight that someone onboard has been in China in the last 14 days. </p>
<p> That guidance was included in a notice released by the department Sunday as new travel restrictions officially go into effect for flights that commenced after 5 p.m. EDT Sunday. </p>
<p> Under the new rules, US citizens who have traveled in China within the last 14 days will be re-routed to one of 11 designated airports, where they will undergo enhanced health screening procedures. </p>
<p> Asked in an interview aired Sunday on Fox how concerned he was over the outbreak, President Trump said that “we pretty much shut it down coming in from China.” </p>
<p> “We’ve offered China help, but we can’t have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus,’’ Trump said. ‘‘So we’re gonna see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.” </p>
<p> Various epidemiological models estimate that the real number of coronavirus cases is 100,000 or even more. Although that expansion is not as rapid as that of flu or measles, it is an enormous leap beyond what virologists saw when SARS and MERS emerged. </p>
<p> When SARS was vanquished in July 2003 after spreading for nine months, only 8,098 cases had been confirmed. MERS has been circulating since 2012, but there have been only about 2,500 known cases. </p>
<p> The biggest uncertainty now, specialists said, is how many people around the world will die. SARS killed about 10 percent of those who got it, and MERS now kills about 1 of 3. </p>
<p> The 1918 “Spanish flu” killed only about 2.5 percent of its victims, but because it infected so many people and medical care was much cruder then, 20 to 50 million died. </p>
<p> By contrast, the highly transmissible H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic of 2009 killed about 285,000, fewer than seasonal flu normally does, and had a relatively low fatality rate, estimated at .02 percent. </p>
<p> The mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has been running about 2 percent, although that is likely to drop as more tests are done and more mild cases are found. </p>
<p> It is “increasingly unlikely that the virus can be contained,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit devoted to fighting epidemics. </p>
<p> “It is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don’t know how far, wide, or deadly it will be.” </p>
<p> In the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, “they were talking about Armageddon in Mexico,” Fauci said. (That virus first emerged in pig-farming areas in Mexico’s Veracruz state.) “But it turned out to not be that severe.” </p>
<p> An accurate estimate of the virus’ lethality will not be possible until certain kinds of studies can be done: blood tests to see how many people have antibodies, household studies to learn how often it infects family members, and genetic sequencing to determine whether some strains are more dangerous than others. </p>
<p> Closing borders to highly infectious pathogens never succeeds completely, specialists said, because all frontiers are somewhat porous. Nonetheless, closings and rigorous screening may slow the spread, which will buy time for the development of drug treatments and vaccines. </p>
<p> Other important unknowns include who is most at risk, whether coughing or contaminated surfaces are more likely to transmit the virus, how fast the virus can mutate, and whether it will fade out when the weather warms. </p>
<p> The effects of a pandemic would probably be harsher in some countries than in others. While the United States and other wealthy countries may be able to detect and quarantine the first carriers, countries with fragile health care systems will not. </p>
<p> The virus has already reached Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Nepal, and rural Russia. </p>
<p> “This looks far more like H1N1’s spread than SARS, and I am increasingly alarmed,” said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Even 1 percent mortality would mean 10,000 deaths in each million people.” </p>
<p> Other specialists were more cautious. Dr. Michael Ryan, head of emergency responses for the World Health Organization, said in an interview with STAT News on Saturday that there was “evidence to suggest this virus can still be contained” and that the world needed to “keep trying.” </p>
<p> Anecdotal reports from China, and one published study from Germany, indicate that some people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus can pass it on before they show symptoms. That may make border-screening much harder, scientists said. </p>
