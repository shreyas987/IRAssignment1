Guideline for Quarantine of Pandemic Influenza
1

Introduction

(1)

Objective

These guidelines are formulated to specify quarantine measures mentioned in the Pandemic
Influenza Preparedness Action Plan of the Japanese Government (hereinafter referred to as
“Action Plan”). The Quarantine Guidelines aim to prevent the intrusion of pandemic influenza
virus at the frontline as far as possible, through bolstered quarantine operations such as the
screening of pandemic influenza patients in Phases 4A through 5A.
Appropriate measures shall be selected and implemented from these guidelines, considering
international situations including response of the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as
the expected infectiousness and pathogenicity of pandemic influenza.
In Phase 5B onwards, the focus of governmental actions shifts from quarantine measures at
frontline and early response strategy to other aspects, and therefore reduction of immigrant
quarantine operations shall be examined.
(2)

Timing of implementation

These guidelines shall be implemented promptly when the WHO announces Phase 4 (Small
cluster(s) with limited human-to-human transmission, but spread is highly localized), and
pandemic influenza is designated as an infectious disease requiring quarantine under Article 34
of the Quarantine Law (Law No. 201, 1951) (hereinafter referred to as “Law”). These
guidelines shall also apply to the cases where human-to-human transmission is identified while
the WHO does not declare Phase 4, but the Government of Japan is required to take the same
domestic measures as in Phase 4.
(3)

Revision of these guidelines

Measures and other provisions in these guidelines are subject to continuous modification and
addition as necessary, in line with new medical and scientific findings (on clinical symptoms*,
epidemiological information etc.), as well as progress in laboratory technologies, pertaining to
pandemic influenza.
*

Clinical symptoms:
Influenza involves fever and respiratory symptoms in general. Symptoms of pandemic
influenza shall be defined anew when human-to-human transmission occurs.
These guidelines are based on the assumption that diagnosis by PCR test would be
possible, because genetic information of pandemic influenza virus will be identified
when pandemic is confirmed.

5

2

Basic matters

(1)

Restriction of travel to and from regions where infection occurs

As a basic idea, as Phase proceeds (or in response to the mutation of viral infectiousness or
pathogenicity), the quality and quantity of quarantine for returnees to Japan shall be ensured by
the following measures.
1)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall examine the issuance of infectious disease alert if
the WHO designates a region for self-restraint from visiting, considering the risk and
situations of that region.

2)

The Government of Japan shall propose Japanese nationals staying in the country or
region where pandemic influenza occurs to examine safety measures including
evacuation, based on the issued infectious disease alert. If the government recommends
evacuation, it shall provide necessary information to related institutions.

3)

In line with the extent of outbreak in the region where infection occurs, the Ministry of
Health, Labour and Welfare shall request airlines etc. through the Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure and Transport to restrain from operations of charter and other flights
arriving at non-quarantine airports. The request for restraint of airline operations shall be
expanded as the threat increases, to include international regular flights etc.

4)

As for vessels and planes arriving from the region where infection occurs, the Ministry of
Health, Labour and Welfare shall examine the designation and integration of domestic
quarantine locations in advance and as necessary, from the viewpoint of prevention of
infection spread, based on the provisions of Section 2, Article 14 of the Law.
• The ministry shall designate Narita, Kansai, Chubu and Fukuoka International
Airports for passenger planes, and quarantined airports for cargo planes.
• The ministry shall designate Yokohama, Kobe, Kanmon Ports and others for
passenger ships, and quarantined ports for cargo ships.
• Cargo ships may be difficult to integrate due to their load and other reasons. In such
cases, the two ministries shall negotiate carefully to determine appropriate measures,
in addition to mandatory risk control actions following advance notification of patients,
etc.
As for detailed methods and timings of the above measures, the Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare shall determine through consultation as necessary with other
governmental agencies, municipalities and other related entities.
The Quarantine Operations Control Office shall examine in detail how to identify
assistant operators and their duties, how to secure required accommodations, and other
necessary issues, so that needs for assistance in quarantine operations should be satisfied
in different situations of integration.

6

Related departments of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare shall ensure that
required personnel would be available from other medical institutions to form medical
teams to respond to requests for assistance.
5)

If vessels and planes from the region where infection occurs continue to arrive at the U.S.
armed force facilities in Japan under the Japan-U.S. Status-of-Forces Agreement, the
Government of Japan shall request its American counterpart to cooperate in appropriate
quarantine measures at the U.S. armed force facilities and areas in Japan, to prevent the
spread of infection.

6)

All related agencies and institutions shall collaborate to share information and seek
cooperation and understanding of the general public, because awareness and active
participation of individual citizens are indispensable for effective quarantine operations
to fight pandemic influenza.

(2)

Response at quarantine stations

Quarantine stations shall identify the status of occurrence and outbreak worldwide, and take
necessary measures as follows for immigrants from the region where infection or outbreak of
pandemic influenza occurs. Measures at quarantine stations include i) Detention under Article
16 of the Law, or isolation under Article 15; and ii) Health monitoring and notification to the
municipalities of passengers’ residence under Article 18. These measures shall target at
suspected patients of pandemic influenza, individuals who heavily contacted with patients, and
general co-passengers. The measures shall be taken based on a) Pre-quarantine notification
under Article 6 of the Law, b) Questionnaire survey on health status (hereinafter referred to as
“questionnaire”; See Attachment 1 printed on the back of Attachment 2), and c) Check-up by
physicians under Article 13.
To ensure effective implementation of the above, the directors of quarantine stations shall
establish in advance initial response scheme for prompt crisis control. Individual quarantine
stations shall have crisis control manuals in place, based on which chain of command and roles
and responsibilities shall be confirmed in advance. The stations shall also conduct regular joint
drills to respond in line with these guidelines. In addition, the stations shall consult with each
other to prepare for assumed actions, in the case that smooth quarantine operations are required
with external assistants who cooperate in turns.
Definitions of “individuals who heavily contacted with patients”:
“Individuals who heavily contacted with patients” include relatives and friends accompanying
suspected patients of pandemic influenza at the time of entry into Japan; groups and tour guides
traveling with suspected patients; crew members attending suspected patients on board;
individuals seated within a specified distance from suspected patients (as determined by the
relevant quarantine station considering on-board air streams, air conditioning, movements of
suspected patients and other related conditions) and so on.
These definitions are subject to modification and addition as necessary, following the
identification of cases of pandemic influenza.

7

(3)

Quarantine measures

1)

Measures for suspected patients of pandemic influenza
If immigrants indicating high fever and coughs are suspected of infection by pandemic
influenza, samples shall be taken on-board and PCR tests shall be conducted at quarantine
stations.
{ In principle, genetic identification by the PCR method shall be conducted at

quarantine stations. If a branch quarantine station or office does not have required
testing equipment, and if the transport of samples to a laboratory station is
inappropriate due to distance reasons, an appropriate testing system shall be
established in advance, such as requesting a nearby health institute to test the relevant
samples. (To request a local health institute to conduct genetic identification by the
PCR method, required arrangements shall be ensured through consultation with the
government of the prefecture.)
After samples are taken, the relevant suspected patients shall be transferred to
designated medical institutions for infectious diseases.
If the PCR test proves positive, samples shall be forwarded to the National Institute of
Infectious Diseases for a confirming test. If the PCR test proves negative, detention of
the relevant individual shall be lifted, though his/her health shall be monitored during
the incubation period.
2)

Detention and isolation (including hospitalization with medical institutions)
If suspected patients of pandemic influenza are identified, the directors of quarantine
stations shall instruct their detention under Article 16 of the Law. The relevant
individuals shall be transferred to designated medical institutions for infectious diseases
for contract detention. In the case of emergency or other inescapable reasons, the
directors of quarantine stations may entrust the hospitalization of suspected patients to
hospitals or clinics other than designated medical institutions for infectious diseases, if
the relevant hospitals/clinics have negative pressure beds and are deemed appropriate by
the directors of quarantine stations. In the above case, the period of detention shall be
determined by subtracting the days between the departure from the region where
infection occurs and the arrival in Japan from ten (10) days. If the PCR test is conducted
and proves positive of pandemic influenza, contract isolation shall commence under
Article 15 of the Law.
It is important to determine in advance communication systems, transfer methods and
other details with contract medical institutions.

8

3)

Response to individuals who heavily contacted with (suspected) patients
Individuals who are considered to have heavily contacted with suspected patients of
pandemic influenza shall wait at appropriate locations in the plane/vessel, airport/port or
elsewhere, until the screening test of suspected patients completes. Quarantine officers or
physicians shall interview and check such individuals while they are waiting.

4)

1

i)

If the PCR test of suspected patients proves positive, the quarantine officers or
physicians shall instruct the detention of individuals who heavily contacted with
them at medical institutions (if beds are full, at alternative hospitalization facilities
available through cooperation of municipalities).

ii)

If any of individuals who heavily contacted with patients are suspected of pandemic
influenza, such individuals shall be tested by the PCR method, and transferred to
designated medical institutions for infectious diseases as necessary.

iii)

If the PCR test of suspected patients proves negative, suggesting the absence of
pandemic influenza virus, individuals who heavily contacted with patients may
leave the waiting locations. Masks shall be distributed to such individuals. Health
of such individuals shall be monitored during the incubation period. (The
monitoring includes a) Wearing of masks distributed at quarantine stations on the
way home, b) Self-restraint from outing for a specified period, c) Reporting of
fevers and other abnormal physical conditions, among other instructions.)

iv)

In the case of health monitoring, quarantine stations shall report to the governors of
prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special districts operating
health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or stay that they are under
health monitoring, and request the cooperation of governors as necessary in the
observation of health status etc., thereby ensuring prompt response in the case of
infection.

Response to general co-passengers (other than individuals who heavily contacted with
patients)
i)

Check the health status of general co-passengers on board, through questionnaires,
thermography1 and other means.

ii)

Identify the names and contact information of such individuals on questionnaires
(See Attachment 2 printed on the back of Attachment 1). Masks shall be distributed
to such individuals. Health of such individuals shall be monitored based on
Attachment 3, Health Report Instructions. (The monitoring includes a) Wearing of
masks distributed at quarantine stations on the way home, b) Self-restraint from
outing for a specified period, c) Taking temperatures in the morning and evening,
and reporting fevers or other abnormal physical conditions, among other
instructions.)

Thermography
Refers to technology of identifying far infrared radiation from objects, images visualizing and analyzing
thermal distribution based on such technology, and equipment to conduct such analysis.

9

5)

6)

iii)

In the case of health monitoring, quarantine stations shall report to the governors of
prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special districts operating
health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or stay that they are under
health monitoring, and request the cooperation of governors as necessary in the
observation of health status etc., thereby ensuring prompt response in the case of
infection.

iv)

“c) Taking temperatures in the morning and evening” is only required if the PCR
test of the relevant suspected patients proves positive. If the PCR test of the relevant
suspected patients proves negative of pandemic influenza, reporting is only
required for fevers and abnormal physical conditions.

v)

The directors of quarantine stations shall report the results of PCR and other tests of
suspected patients of pandemic influenza promptly to the governors of prefectures
(the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special districts operating health
centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or stay.

Response to passengers of vessels and planes arriving from the region where infection
occurs, in the case that no (suspected) patients are reported
i)

Identify the names and contact information of such passengers (individuals) on
questionnaires, based on Section 2, Article 18 of the Law.

ii)

Masks shall be distributed to such individuals. Health of such individuals shall be
monitored based on the Health Report Instructions. (The monitoring includes a)
Wearing of masks distributed at quarantine stations on the way home, b)
Self-restraint from outing for a specified period, c) Reporting of fevers and other
abnormal physical conditions, among other instructions.)

iii)

If any of individuals under health monitoring instructed by quarantine stations
report abnormal physical conditions after going home, the relevant quarantine
stations shall notify promptly the health status of the relevant individuals, as well as
instructions provided to and information reported from such individuals, to the
governors of prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special
districts operating health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or stay,
using the designated form (Attachment 4) based on Section 3, Article 18 of the
Law.

iv)

At the same time, the directors of quarantine stations shall report measures that they
implemented to the Tuberculosis and Infectious Diseases Control Division of the
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, through the Quarantine Operations
Control Office.

Other
It is necessary that quarantine stations examine as necessary the separation of traffic lines
of immigrants from the country where pandemic influenza occurs and of those from other
countries, to prevent the spread of infection, such as installing an arrival gate dedicated
for airplanes arriving from the country where infection occurs.

10

(4)

Issuing provisional certificate of pratique2

If the threat of intrusion of pandemic influenza virus is considered minimal based on quarantine
results, provisional certificate of pratique may be issued to vessels and planes (entering and)
departing from the region where infection occurs and arriving in Japan within the incubation
period, valid for a specified period shorter than the incubation period.
If provisional certificate of pratique is issued, the relevant vessel shall submit a list of ports it
plans to enter within the incubation period, and report any abnormal physical conditions during
that time to the issuing quarantine station. If such abnormalities are reported, the relevant
quarantine station shall inform the quarantine station near the port in which the relevant vessel
currently anchors, as well as the governor of the relevant prefecture. The station shall also
report the abnormalities to the Tuberculosis and Infectious Diseases Control Division, through
the Quarantine Operations Control Office.
(5)

Information collection and provision

1)

To implement effective quarantine measures, it is extremely important to collect prompt
and accurate information on the regions where infection occurs, through the WHO and
other international organizations, state governments, and Japanese diplomatic
establishments abroad (such as embassies and consulates general). If the Quarantine
Operations Control Office obtains such information, prompt and appropriate quarantine
measures shall be taken based on the obtained information.

2)

Because awareness and active participation of individual citizens are indispensable for
effective quarantine operations to fight pandemic influenza, quarantine stations shall
provide both immigrants and emigrants with information on the status of pandemic
influenza overseas, measures to prevent infection etc. under the provisions of Section 1,
Article 27-2 of the Law. Quarantine stations shall take any available measures for such
public relations, including announcement on station websites; putting up posters at
quarantine stations in ports and airports, as well as at departure lobbies; distribution of
leaflets; announcement by quarantine officers; and so on.

3)

In principle, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare shall take charge of media
relations and other external liaison activities concerning suspected or confirmed patients
of pandemic influenza. If such activities by quarantine stations are required, they shall
respond accordingly through consultation with the Quarantine Operations Control Office.

2

Provisional certificate of pratique
Provisional certificate of pratique is only issued when the pathogen of quarantined infectious disease is
considered unlikely to intrude into Japan. If the certificate of pratique cannot be issued because the days
between the departure and the arrival in Japan are shorter than the incubation period of the quarantined
infectious disease or for other reasons, but if the threat of intrusion of the pathogen is considered minimal,
the provisional certificate of pratique may be issued on condition that temperatures etc. should be reported
as necessary for a specified period. Vessels and planes may only enter Japanese ports if either of the above
is issued.

11

(6)

Collaboration with related institutions

Based on these guidelines, quarantine stations shall promote information sharing and
collaboration with related institutions, including prefectural governments, to prevent the spread
of pandemic influenza into Japan through quarantine operations. For example, quarantine
stations shall announce the bolstered quarantine requirements in Japan during the boarding
process to ensure the understanding and cooperation of passengers, in collaboration with
airlines and shipping companies.
Quarantine stations shall also coordinate with other port and airport establishments relating to
quarantine operations, to ensure prompt response in crisis control (for example, by identifying
emergency contacts).
(7)

Securing safety of quarantine officers etc.

1)

It is necessary to provide quarantine officers etc. with specific explanations on infection
prevention, response in the case of infection, protective measures for families,
designation of public occupational hazards, and so on, so that the officers may
concentrate on quarantine operations.

2)

Quarantine officers shall have necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) at hand
during quarantine operations. They shall also have good proficiency in the use of PPE.

3)

Quarantine stations shall also emphasize and disseminate hand washing, disinfection of
hands and fingers with disinfectant ethanol and gargling etc. for post-quarantine
decontamination.

4)

If it is identified that employees of quarantine stations have contacted with (suspected)
patients of pandemic influenza, and if such employees are infected or suspected of
infection, measures shall be taken as required by the Law. Specific procedures must be
formulated in advance to ensure medical treatment of such employees.

5)

Employees of quarantine stations are included in the scope of proactive epidemiological
research conducted by the governors of prefectures under Article 15 of the Law.
Therefore, it shall be disseminated in advance that the station employees shall cooperate
to such research.

12

3

Quarantine response

(1)

Quarantine of airplanes

1)

If pre-quarantine notification by an airplane arriving from the region where infection
occurs reports that individuals were identified on board indicating symptoms of pandemic
influenza, the following response shall be taken.
i)

ii)

Pre-arrival response
a)

If pre-quarantine notification (as specified by Article 6 of the Law) by an
airplane arriving from the region where infection occurs reports that
individuals were identified on board indicating symptoms of pandemic
influenza, the relevant quarantine station shall confirm with the captain of the
flight before its arrival on information required to determine that the reported
individuals may have been infected by pandemic influenza.

b)

If it is identified through the process of a) that there are individuals on board
matching the definitions for symptoms of pandemic influenza, the director of
the quarantine station shall contact the airline company and others to confirm
that infection prevention measures are in place on that flight.

c)

In principle, on-board quarantine shall be implemented in such cases. The
quarantine station shall consult with the airline company and other related
entities on required actions.

d)

The director of the quarantine station shall notify planned quarantine
measures for the relevant flight to the immigration authorities, aeronautical
stations and other related agencies in advance.

Pre-arrival instructions
Through the airline company, the director of the quarantine station shall request the
captain of the relevant flight to cooperate in the following measures.
a)

Taking measures for scattering prevention, such as requesting the reported
individuals to wear masks as far as possible;

b)

Limiting crew members attending the reported individuals, and instructing
such dedicated crew members to keep masks on;

c)

Taking as much clearance as possible between the reported individuals and
other passengers; The dedicated crew members shall guide the reported
individuals to the backmost seats etc. to take sufficient distance from other
passengers;

d)

If it is impossible to take distance between the reported individuals and other
passengers, take additional preventive measures such as requesting
passengers around the reported individuals to wear masks; and

13

e)

Designating a dedicated lavatory nearest to the reported individuals, which
other passengers shall not use.
These measures do not apply to cargo-only planes.

iii)

Implementation of on-board quarantine
On-board quarantine shall be implemented in the following procedures. These
procedures shall also apply to the cases where other forms of quarantine are
adopted for inescapable reasons.
a)

Quarantine officers shall enter the plane, and check whether there is distance
between the reported individuals and other passengers, and if there is no
distance, whether passengers around the reported individuals wear masks.
Under the provisions of Article 12 of the Law, quarantine officers shall also
distribute questionnaires, survey sheets, and Health Report Instructions to all
passengers and crew members, and instruct them to fill the distributed forms.

b)

Quarantine officers (physicians) shall interview and check the reported
individuals on board, referring to the questionnaires. If physicians diagnose
the reported individuals as suspected patients of pandemic influenza, the
physicians shall report accordingly to the director of the quarantine station,
who shall in turn determine detention measures (transfer and detention) for
the suspected patients following sampling for laboratory tests.

c)

Quarantine officers shall guide the suspected patients directly from the plane
to the transfer vehicle, using wheelchairs etc. as necessary.
Until preparations for transfer are complete, quarantine officers shall have the
relevant suspected patients wait at appropriate locations in or around the
quarantine station.

d)

Individuals who are considered to have heavily contacted with suspected
patients of pandemic influenza shall wait at appropriate locations in the plane,
airport facilities or elsewhere (detailed instructions are under examination),
until the screening test of suspected patients completes. Quarantine officers
(physicians) shall interview and check such individuals while they are
waiting, based on the questionnaires.
If the PCR test of suspected patients proves positive, the quarantine officers
or physicians shall instruct the detention of individuals who heavily contacted
with them at medical institutions (if beds are full, at alternative
hospitalization facilities available through cooperation of municipalities).
If any of individuals who heavily contacted with patients are suspected of
pandemic influenza, such individuals shall be tested by the PCR method, and
transferred to designated medical institutions for infectious diseases as
necessary.

14

If the PCR test of suspected patients proves negative, suggesting the absence
of pandemic influenza virus, individuals who heavily contacted with patients
may leave the waiting locations. Masks shall be distributed to such
individuals. Health of such individuals shall be monitored during the
incubation period, based on the Health Status Instructions. (The monitoring
includes a) Wearing of masks distributed at quarantine stations on the way
home, b) Self-restraint from outing for a specified period, c) Reporting of
fevers and other abnormal physical conditions, among other instructions.)
In the case of health monitoring, quarantine stations shall report to the
governors of prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special
districts operating health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or
stay that they are under health monitoring, and request the cooperation of
governors as necessary in the observation of health status etc., thereby
ensuring prompt response in the case of infection.
The directors of quarantine stations shall report the results of PCR and other
tests of suspected patients of pandemic influenza promptly to the governors
of prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special districts
operating health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or stay.
e)

After suspected patients and individuals who heavily contacted with patients
are guided out of the plane, quarantine officers shall collect questionnaires etc.
from general co-passengers, and check their health status by thermography
and other methods. If abnormalities are identified, physicians shall check the
relevant passengers (individuals). Quarantine officers shall then identify the
names and contact information of such individuals on questionnaires (See
Attachment 2 printed on the back of Attachment 1). Masks shall be
distributed to such individuals. Health of such individuals shall be monitored
based on Attachment 3, Health Report Instructions. (The monitoring includes
a) Wearing of masks distributed at quarantine stations on the way home, b)
Self-restraint from outing for a specified period, c) Taking temperatures in
the morning and evening, and reporting fevers or other abnormal physical
conditions, among other instructions.)
In the case of health monitoring, quarantine stations shall report to the
governors of prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special
districts operating health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or
stay that they are under health monitoring, and request the cooperation of
governors as necessary in the observation of health status etc., thereby
ensuring prompt response in the case of infection.
Note that “c) Taking temperatures in the morning and evening” is only
required if the PCR test of the relevant suspected patients proves positive. If
the PCR test of the relevant suspected patients proves negative of pandemic
influenza, reporting is only required for fevers and abnormal physical
conditions.
The directors of quarantine stations shall report the results of PCR and other
tests of suspected patients of pandemic influenza promptly to the governors

15

of prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special districts
operating health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or stay.

iv)

f)

Quarantine officers shall report measures that they implemented to the
Tuberculosis and Infectious Diseases Control Division of the Ministry of
Health, Labour and Welfare, through the Quarantine Operations Control
Office.

g)

Quarantine officers shall request the captain of the flight and the airline
company to keep air conditioning in the plane on during quarantine
operations on board and around the airplane, and to instruct maintenance
operators not to come near the plane’s air outlets, for the sake of infection

Measures related to suspected patients of pandemic influenza
a)

b)

c)

Basic matters before transfer
(a)

The directors of quarantine stations shall notify the information of
suspected patients and expected arrival time to the designated medical
institutions for infectious diseases (in the case of emergency or other
inescapable reasons, hospitals or clinics other than designated medical
institutions for infectious diseases, if the relevant hospitals/clinics have
negative pressure beds and are deemed appropriate by the directors of
quarantine stations), to ensure appropriate infection control at the
arrival of suspected patients.

(b)

The directors of quarantine stations shall notify the transfer of
suspected patients in advance to immigrant authorities, customs and
other related agencies, as well as municipal agencies (including health
centers governing the locations of the airport and medical institutions).

contacted, utensils that they used etc.

Transfer of individuals who heavily contacted with patients
Quarantine officers shall transfer individuals who are diagnosed as relatively
likely to be infected in transfer vehicles to medical institutions (if beds are
full, to alternative hospitalization facilities available through cooperation of
municipalities).
Quarantine officers shall request such individuals to wear masks, and take
necessary protective measures for themselves to prevent any risks of
infection.

e)

Response to reports from individuals under health monitoring
In principle, if any of individuals under health monitoring instructed by
quarantine stations report abnormal physical conditions after going home, the
relevant quarantine stations shall notify promptly the health status of the
relevant individuals, as well as instructions provided to and information
reported from such individuals, to the governors of prefectures (the mayors
and heads of wards for cities and special districts operating health centers) in
which the relevant individuals reside or stay, using the designated form based
on Section 3, Article 18 of the Law. Quarantine stations shall also report the
abnormalities to the Tuberculosis and Infectious Diseases Control Division,
through the Quarantine Operations Control Office.
This does not apply to such individuals for whom the cooperation of relevant
municipal governments is ensured in the observation of health status etc.

2)

If pre-quarantine notification reports that no individuals were identified on board
indicating symptoms of pandemic influenza
Quarantine officers shall request the captain of the airplane arriving from the region
where infection occurs to submit and/or present documentation specified by Section 2,
Article 11 of the Law, and confirm that there are no individuals on board indicating
symptoms of pandemic influenza based on the submitted/presented documentation (e.g.
written declaration).
i)

Questionnaires and temperatures
Quarantine officers shall collect questionnaires from all passengers and crew
members arriving from the region where infection occurs, beside the plane.
Quarantine officers shall check the health status of passengers and the levels of
exposure to pandemic influenza before arrival. They shall also take the
temperatures of passengers using thermography, radiation thermometers and other
methods, thereby identifying individuals with high fevers.
Quarantine officers shall then identify the names and contact information of such
individuals on survey sheets, based on Section 2, Article 18 of the Law. Masks shall
be distributed to such individuals. Health of such individuals shall be monitored

17

based on Health Report Instructions. (The monitoring includes a) Wearing of masks
distributed at quarantine stations on the way home, b) Self-restraint from outing for
a specified period, and c) Reporting of fevers or other abnormal physical conditions,
among other instructions.)
If any of individuals under health monitoring instructed by quarantine stations
report abnormal physical conditions after going home, the relevant quarantine
stations shall report immediately the abnormalities to the Tuberculosis and
Infectious Diseases Control Division, through the Quarantine Operations Control
Office. The quarantine stations shall also notify promptly the health status of the
relevant individuals, as well as instructions provided to and information reported
from such individuals, to the governors of prefectures (the mayors and heads of
wards for cities and special districts operating health centers) in which the relevant
individuals reside or stay, using the designated form based on Section 3, Article 18
of the Law (Attachment 4).
ii)

Response to individuals indicating symptoms of pandemic influenza

through or stays in the region where infection occurs as far as possible. Quarantine
stations shall also seek to identify (suspected) patients in the departure area, with
cooperation of ground personnel. If individuals indicating symptoms of pandemic
influenza request immigration for medical or other treatment, the same measures as
normal quarantine shall be taken as specified by 3 – (1) – 1) – iii) onwards.

(2)

Quarantine of vessels

1)

If pre-quarantine notification by a vessel arriving from the region where infection occurs
within the incubation period reports that individuals were identified on board indicating
symptoms of pandemic influenza
The relevant quarantine station shall confirm with the captain of the vessel before its
arrival on information required to determine that the reported individuals may have been
infected by pandemic influenza. If it is identified through the process as above that there
are individuals on board suspected of infection by pandemic influenza, the director of the
quarantine station shall instruct on-board or on-shore quarantine3 at a quarantine port
based on Section 2, Article 14 of the Law, even though the relevant vessel has prior
permit to enter a non-quarantine port.

3

On-board or on-shore quarantine
In on-board quarantine, quarantine officers instruct an arriving vessel to anchor in the designated quarantine
area, and inspect the vessel on board. If quarantine in the designated area is difficult due to bad weather, cargo
of hazardous substances etc., the director of the quarantine station may instruct on-shore quarantine, where
quarantine officers inspect the vessel on board after it anchors alongside the pier.

18

The director of the quarantine station shall contact the shipping agent and others to notify
the implementation of on-board or on-shore quarantine based on Section 3, Article 8 of
the Quarantine Law, and confirm that appropriate infection prevention measures are in
place on that vessel.
On-shore quarantine shall be implemented if on-board quarantine is difficult due to bad
weather, transfer of (suspected) patients etc. Quarantine stations shall determine in
advance the piers, locations and other details of on-shore quarantine through consultation
with port administrators, coast guard departments and other related entities.
i)

Pre-arrival instructions
If quarantine officers receive notification from a vessel arriving from the region
where infection occurs within the incubation period that individuals indicating
symptoms of pandemic influenza were identified among its passengers or crew
members, the quarantine officers shall contact the relevant vessel through its
shipping agent to notify the implementation of on-board or on-shore quarantine,
and to provide the following instructions.

Quarantine officers shall also distribute the survey sheet (Attachment 2) and
Health Report Instructions (Attachment 3), and request passengers and crew
members to fill the distributed forms.

c)

Quarantine officers (physicians) shall interview and check the reported
individuals in a separate room on the vessel, referring to the questionnaires. If
physicians diagnose the reported individuals as suspected patients of
pandemic influenza, the physicians shall report accordingly to the director of
the quarantine station, who shall in turn determine detention measures
(transfer and detention) for the suspected patients following sampling for
laboratory tests. The director of the quarantine station shall then instruct
quarantine officers to prepare for transfer to medical institutions.

d)

Individuals who are considered to have heavily contacted with suspected
patients of pandemic influenza shall wait at appropriate locations in the vessel,
port facilities or elsewhere, until the screening test of suspected patients
completes. Quarantine officers (physicians) shall interview and check such
individuals while they are waiting, based on the questionnaires.
If the PCR test of suspected patients proves positive, the quarantine officers
or physicians shall instruct the detention of individuals who heavily contacted
with them in the vessel or at medical institutions (if beds are full, at
alternative hospitalization facilities available through cooperation of
municipalities) during the incubation period.
If any of individuals who heavily contacted with patients are suspected of
pandemic influenza during the detention period, such individuals shall be
tested by the PCR method, and transferred to designated medical institutions
for infectious diseases as necessary.

20

If the PCR test of suspected patients proves negative, suggesting the absence
of pandemic influenza virus, individuals who heavily contacted with patients
may leave the waiting locations. Masks shall be distributed to such
individuals. Health of such individuals shall be monitored during the
incubation period, based on the Health Status Instructions. (The monitoring
includes a) Wearing of masks distributed at quarantine stations on the way
home, b) Self-restraint from outing for a specified period, c) Reporting of
fevers and other abnormal physical conditions, among other instructions.)
In the case of health monitoring, quarantine stations shall report to the
governors of prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special
districts operating health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or
stay that they are under health monitoring, and request the cooperation of
governors as necessary in the observation of health status etc., thereby
ensuring prompt response in the case of infection.
The directors of quarantine stations shall report the results of PCR and other
tests of suspected patients of pandemic influenza promptly to the governors
of prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special districts
operating health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or stay.
e)

After suspected patients and individuals who heavily contacted with patients
are guided out of the vessel, quarantine officers shall collect questionnaires
etc. from general passengers and crew members, and check their health status
by thermography and other methods on board. If abnormalities are identified,
physicians shall check the relevant passengers (individuals). Quarantine
officers shall then identify the names and contact information of such
individuals on questionnaires (See Attachment 2 printed on the back of
Attachment 1). Masks shall be distributed to such individuals. Health of such
individuals shall be monitored based on Attachment 3, Health Report
Instructions. (The monitoring includes a) Wearing of masks distributed at
quarantine stations on the way home, b) Self-restraint from outing for a
specified period, c) Taking temperatures in the morning and evening, and
reporting fevers or other abnormal physical conditions, among other
instructions.)
In the case of health monitoring, quarantine stations shall report to the
governors of prefectures (the mayors and heads of wards for cities and special
districts operating health centers) in which the relevant individuals reside or
stay that they are under health monitoring, and request the cooperation of
governors as necessary in the observation of health status etc., thereby
ensuring prompt response in the case of infection.
Note that “c) Taking temperatures in the morning and evening” is only
required if the PCR test of the relevant suspected patients proves positive. If
the PCR test of the relevant suspected patients proves negative of pandemic
influenza, reporting is only required for fevers and abnormal physical
conditions.
The directors of quarantine stations shall report the results of PCR and other
tests of suspected patients of pandemic influenza promptly to the governors
