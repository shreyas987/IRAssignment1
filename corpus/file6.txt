<p> Coronavirus digest: New restrictions in Europe as cases soar </p>
<p> European nations are trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 with tougher measures across the continent. New York City sent elementary schoolers back to class to test if its school system was ready. </p>
<p> Spain, Poland, Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia all enacted new restrictions on Wednesday as case numbers surged across the continent. </p>
<p> The Netherlands, Northern Ireland, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Slovakia and Romania all saw record numbers of daily infections. Cases have also been alarmingly high in other countries, with France again recording more than 10,000 cases. </p>
<p> In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel made an impassioned appeal for patience and discipline as numbers increased. Merkel said Germany risks undoing the gains it has made, asking citizens to care for one and other, and calling for vigilance on hygiene measures such as social-distancing and mask-wearing. </p>
<p> "We risk everything that we have achieved in the past few months," Merkel said in a speech to the German parliament. </p>
<p> Europe </p>
<p> Germany reported 1,798 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, a tally from the public health body Robert Koch Institute showed. The death toll rose by 17 in the past 24 hours. </p>
<p> The German federal statistics office, Destatis, meanwhile, said inflation fell below zero in Germany for the second time this year. Inflation dropped to minus 0.2% in September, two months after inflation was minus 0.1%. Destatis said the negative inflation rate was attributable to several things, including a reduction in value-added tax (VAT) which was introduced in July to slow the recession brought on by the pandemic. </p>

<p> Israel's parliament has passed a bill that would allow the government to stymie protests during a lockdown, a measure that has provoked unrest in recent days. The legislation allows the government to declare a week-long state of emergency if the coronavirus spreads out of control. If such a state is called, the government would be able to limit group participation, including protests, to 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from a person's home. Previously, hundreds of Israelis had protested against the measure, blocking streets surrounding the parliament, and demonstrating outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence. </p>
<p> Israel also reported that more than 25% of ultra-Orthodox Israelis are testing positive. About 12% of the country's nine million citizens are ultra-Orthodox Jews. </p>

<p> World </p>
<p> The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade association of the world's airlines, has warned that there will be even fewer flights around the world now with coronavirus cases surging. The IATA warned that flights in the northern hemisphere will now be 66% below the number of flights in 2019. It could cause hundreds of thousands of jobs in the airline industry to disappear and estimated that global traffic would not reach pre-pandemic levels until 2024. </p>
<p> Neanderthal genes: New research shows that people with a certain genetic variation inherited from Neanderthals have a much higher risk factor for contracting severe COVID-19. "The probability that humans who inherited this gene variation have to be put on a ventilator when they contract the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 is three times higher," said Hugo Zeberg, an evolutionary anthropologist at Germany's Max Planck Institute. The variation appears in the genome of almost half of people in South Asia, particularly in Bangladesh. Just 16% of people in Europe have the variation, while in Africa and East Asia, it is almost non-existent. </p>
