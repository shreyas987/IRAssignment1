<p> Our coverage of the coronavirus </p>
<p> A selection of our stories about covid-19 and its consequences </p>
<p> The novel coronavirus has infected millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world since it first emerged in China last December. It has compelled many governments to lock down their populations to a degree unimaginable until recently. It is causing the most brutal recession in living memory. At The Economist, we are analysing every aspect of the pandemic—from the science to its political, economic and social consequences—with rigour and a global perspective. And we have invited thinkers outside the newspaper to share their views on the world after covid-19. Every piece we publish is fact-checked.
